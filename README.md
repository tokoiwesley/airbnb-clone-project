# Airbnb Clone Project

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## Project Goals

### Frontend

1. Learn to implement responsive UI/UX designs
2. Understand how to structure a complex web application
3. Practice working in a team with defined roles
4. Develop skills in component-based frontend architecture
5. Learn best practices for web application development

### Backend

1. <b>User Management</b>: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. <b>Property Management</b>: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. <b>Booking System</b>: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. <b>Payment Processing</b>: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. <b>Review System</b>: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. <b>Data Optimization</b>: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Feature Breakdown

## API Security

1. <b>Authentication</b>: Verification of the identity of users in the system.
2. <b>Authorisation</b>: Determining what a verified user is allowed to do in the system.
3. <b>Rate limiting</b>: Controls the number of requests a client can make to the system API within a specific timeframe.

## CI/CD Pipeline
